# Supply-Chain-Management-with-ACO-Algorithm

The goal of this project is to develop the ACO algorithm to optimize the supply chain management. The code is supported by the paper named **Development of an ant colony optimisation-based heuristic for a location-routing problem in a two-stage supply chain**, published in **2018** by **Vinay V. Panicker**, **M. Vamshidhar Reddy** and **R. Sridharan**.
